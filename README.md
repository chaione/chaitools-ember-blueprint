# ChaiTools Ember Blueprint
Provides an Ember.js application blueprint for use with `ember new --blueprint` command.

## Usage
To create a new Ember project using this blueprint, simply run the following command (requires Ember CLI 2.14+):

```
ember new my-awesome-new-app -b chaitools-ember-blueprint
```

To use the latest blueprint that hasn't been published to NPM, run this (works with older versions of Ember CLI):

```
ember new my-awesome-new-app -b https://github.com/chaione/chaitools-ember-blueprint.git
```
